# Turtlebot_Navigation
# Python code for Turtlebot Navigation using ROS

# To run the code pull master into a repo and then cd into the folder in terminal. Run catkin_make to make the catkin workspace. Then, run "source devel/setup.bash" followed by "rosrun navigation Turtlebot.py"

# If running with a Turtlebot, first connect to it and on the Turtlebot run "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch" and "roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch". Then on your computer run "roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch". Then open a new terminal and cd into the repo and run the "source devel/setup.bash" and "rosrun lab5 Turtlebot.py".
